                "Lucid dreaming (LD), the awareness of dreaming during sleep, has gained scientific interest due to its clinical potential and benefits, such as treating chronic nightmares, narcolepsy, and PTSD, as well as enhancing creativity and problem-solving. Eye movements performed after gaining dream awareness have become the research standard. Despite its promise, LD remains rare, with only 53% experiencing it once and 23% regularly (Saunders, 2016). This rarity poses challenges, as the neuroscience of LD is still partially understood.",
                "Methods like Wake Back to Bed (WBTB), reality testing, and sensory stimulation during REM sleep aim to induce LD, but risks like sleep disruption and paralysis highlight the need for safer techniques. Neurobiological studies show changes in EEG patterns during LD but remain inconclusive due to methodological variability and participant differences.",
                "The ISoLDE approach proposes large-scale collaborations and home-based studies using wearable EEG devices to address challenges like small sample sizes and costly lab setups. Involving LD enthusiasts with extensive experience may uncover nuances in the phenomenon and improve induction methods. Harnessing these insights could enhance both awareness and control in LD, paving the way for effective therapeutic applications."

                "Before the experiment, LD experts will fill out a battery of questionnaires (group A) and take part in micro-phenomenological interviews via zoom. The lucid dreaming experts will use a wearable EEG for ~4 weeks. They will record each night and complete questionnaires (group B) each evening/morning. Once a week, participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires from group C. When participants have lucid dreams, they should indicate their state using LRLR (left-right-left-right) visual signaling.",
                "Participants should document their LD induction method in detail, either in writing or verbally, depending on their preference. For the first 3 weeks, participants will be asked to induce LD in the standard way; in the last week of the study, participants will be asked to stop induction (control week), however, continue to wear the EEG band. The control group will be gender- and age-matched with the LD expert group, never experiencing LD. They will be asked to wear a wearable EEG for a week while sleeping. Before the experiment, control group will fill out a battery of questionnaires (group A). They will record each night and complete questionnaires (group B) each evening/morning without free-form documentation. Once a week, participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires from group C."
